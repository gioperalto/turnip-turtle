# Turnip Turtles
This program runs a turtle race with all of the players you enter into the players.txt file. It's a fun spin on traditional randomization.

Instructions (how to run the program) from a Terminal/Python client:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed (I use Python 3.x):
  - `pip install numpy`
2. To run the program: `python battlefield.py`

To change the players:
- There is a `players.txt` file where you can change out the names
- The names in players.txt are newline seperated
