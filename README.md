# Turnip Turtles
This program runs a turtle race with all of the players you enter into the players.txt file. It's a fun spin on traditional randomization.

## Instructions (how to run the program) from a Terminal/Python client:
1. Have Python (and pip) installed (I use Python 3.x)
2. Install the dependencies:
    - `pip install numpy`               (for Math stuff)
    - `pip install sys`                 (for command line arguments)
3. To run the program: 
    - `python battlefield.py`           (creates program with default image)
    - `python battlefield.py turnip`    (creates program with turnip image)
    - `python battlefield.py bells`     (will create program with default image)

## To change the players:
- There is a `players.txt` file where you can change out the names
- The names in players.txt are newline seperated
